# Monte Carlo Simulation Results for Urban HUC12 Watersheds

This repository contains the results of Monte Carlo simulations for extreme precipitation trends across 180 HUC12 watersheds in eight flood-prone U.S. inland cities, as summarized in Table 1 of the associated manuscript.

## Folder Structure

- `HUC12_MC_Results/`  
  Contains figure files of Monte Carlo simulation outputs for each individual watershed, organized by city.

## About the Results

Each figure illustrates the trend analysis for extreme precipitation in a specific watershed, including:
- Time series of daily precipitation.
- Identification of extreme event frequency and magnitude.
- Results of Monte Carlo trend testing and summary statistics.

Monte Carlo simulations were applied using the n-largest and annual maximum methods, with multiple testing correction using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach.
